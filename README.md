Getting LLMs to write Svelte 5 isn’t easy and dumping raw documentation isn’t the move. It’s too verbose, too ambiguous, and overloads the token context. LLMs already know Svelte 3 and 4, and since Svelte 5 didn’t change everything, the full docs are mostly noise. What LLMs actually want is clean, annotated code that reveals patterns. Let the LLM infer the rest.

This file delivers a focused, example-first breakdown of what’s new in Svelte 5: runes and reactivity, event handling, snippets and TS stuff. Everything’s shown through minimal, well-commented examples.

If you’re trying to bring an LLM up to speed on Svelte 5, this is a great minimal context dump (but by no means perfect).
