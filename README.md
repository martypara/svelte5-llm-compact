Getting LLMs to write Svelte 5 isn’t easy and dumping raw documentation isn’t the move. It’s too verbose, too ambiguous, and overloads the token context. What LLMs actually want is clean, annotated code that reveals patterns. Let the LLM infer the rest.

This file delivers a focused, example-first breakdown of what’s new in Svelte 5: runes and reactivity, event handling and snippets. Everything’s shown through minimal, well-commented examples.

If you’re trying to bring an LLM up to speed on Svelte 5, this is a great minimal context dump (but by no means perfect).
